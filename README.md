# Markdown Stupefy

<!-- TBA: badges -->

Tired of manually fixing the em dashes and smart quotes in the Markdown
copied from AI tools? This extension converts these smart punctuations
to their ASCII equivalents so you don't have to.

Also has a command for removing all emojis from the text.

## Why the name?

The extension name is based on the "stupefy mode" described in the
[SmartyPants](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/)
project by John Gruber.
