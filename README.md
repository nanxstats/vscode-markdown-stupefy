![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanxstats/vscode-markdown-stupefy/main/assets/banner.png)

Tired of manually fixing the em dashes and smart quotes in the Markdown
copied from AI tools? This extension converts these smart punctuations
to their ASCII equivalents so you don't have to.

Also has commands for common AI-generated text cleanup tasks, such as
removing emojis, clean up trailing whitespace, and ensure one newline
at end of file.

[SmartyPants](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/)
project by John Gruber.
